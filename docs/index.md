# Internet of Things - From Scratch!

Or, how to build your own smart home based around a microservice architecture.

# What Is This?

This site is a guide for building your own IoT (or Smart Home, etc) Infrastructure using MQTT and a collection of services. Think of it as the Smart Home equivalent of [Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/).

# Why Would I want To Build My Own IoT?

There are many reasons people decide to build their own smarthome infrastructure:

* Learning- It's a great way to learn about microservice architectures and how to run them.
* Reliability- You want a system that you can make as reliable and resiliant as possible.
* Security- Because that's what the S in IoT stands for.
* Control- You want to control exactly what runs in your home, not turn it over to Big Tech.

# Why don't you use HomeAssistant/openHAB/ioBroker/etc?

Those are fine tools. In fact, they might be a part of your IoT-FS setup in some capacity! This site is not about foregoing those tools, but about building an IoT platform that is specific to you.
