Think of it as the Smart Home equivalent of Linux From Scratch . Why Would I want To Build My Own IoT? \u00b6 There are many reasons people decide to build their own smarthome infrastructure: Learning- It's a great way to learn about microservice architectures and how to run them. Reliability- You want a system that you can make as reliable and resiliant as possible. Security- Because that's what the S in IoT stands for. Control- You want to control exactly what runs in your home, not turn it over to Big Tech. Why don't you use HomeAssistant/openHAB/ioBroker/etc? \u00b6 Those are fine tools. In fact, they might be a part of your IoT-FS setup in some capacity! This book is not about foregoing those tools, but about building an IoT platform that is specific to you.

While it is focused on defining and running multi-container applications it also works well for managing the configuration of single-container applications. See the official documentation for a more in-depth explanation. Why Would You Want To Use Docker Compose? \u00b6 When you first start out you may wonder why you want to go to this extra work. You can just launch containers directly and they stay running, and all my services are simple. What benefit does this provide? The answer to that question will come in a few days, weeks, or months, when you are ready to change your system. When it's time to docker pull a new upstream container you will have to destroy and recreate the container. Will you remember every argument you passed the first time? What happens if you have a drive failure and you have to rebuild everything? With a proper Docker Compose setup you don't have to worry about any of that, because your exact configuration will be documented in docker-compose.yml files. Structure For Your Docker Compose Infrastructure \u00b6 While it is possible to work with multiple docker-compose.yml files within the same directory, most people find it easier to build a directory tree to store their services and configuration. This allows for a lot of flexibility when it comes to building and managing your services. There are many ways you manage these files, but this is what we recommend for maximum flexibility and ease of use. Basic setup \u00b6 First, pick a home for your directory tree. This can be anywhere, but in most situations we recommend /srv/docker . For the rest of this guide we will assume you have placed your directory tree there. sudo mkdir -p /srv/docker-compose sudo chown ` whoami ` /srv/docker-compose # Optional, but makes # it easier to manage Within this directory you will create directories for every service you want to run. Note The term \"service\" here is used in a slightly different way than you may be used to. In this context a service is any collection of one or more containers. Each container runs a single daemon process, which is what you may be used to thinking of as a service. Create Your First Service \u00b6 Let's start by setting up a service for the Mosquitto MQTT broker. This will demonstrate setting up a simple service which someone else has published a container for. First we'll create directories for it. Notice that we have created a directory in /srv/docker-compose and directories for volume mounts in /srv/mosquitto . If you are setting up a service that doesn't need volume mounts you can skip that. mkdir -p /srv/docker-compose/mosquitto /srv/mosquitto/conf /srv/mosquitto/data /srv/mosquitto/log Create the /srv/docker-compose/mosquitto/docker-compose.yml file: /srv/docker-compose/mosquitto/docker-compose.yml version: \"3\" services: mosquitto: image: eclipse-mosquitto volumes: - ./conf:/mosquitto/conf - ./data:/mosquitto/data - ./log:/mosquitto/log ports: - 1883:1883 - 9001:9001 Create the mosquitto.conf configuration file: /srv/mosquitto/conf/mosquitto.conf persistence true persistence_location /mosquitto/data/ log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log listener 1883 Once this is in place you can use docker-compose to bring it up: cd /srv/docker-compose/mosquitto docker-compose up --detach If you want to watch the logs you can attach to them like this: cd /srv/docker-compose/mosquitto docker-compose logs To bring the service down: cd /srv/docker-compose/mosquitto docker-compose down Custom Docker Containers \u00b6 Sometimes you need to customize a container before it gets deployed. Docker provides a mechanism for doing so using Dockerfile . We'll demonstrate how to do that by creating a custom nginx service. As before we need to create the docker-compose directory: mkdir -p /srv/docker-compose/nginx/nginx Notice that we did not include a data directory in /srv , and we added an extra /nginx to the end of our path? The first nginx path component refers to the service, while the second nginx path component refers to the container. Now we create the docker-compose.yml file: /srv/docker-compose/nginx/docker-compose.yml version: '3' services: nginx: build: ./nginx ports: - \"80:80\" This is where the second nginx directory comes into play- we are going to create a Dockerfile and an index.html inside of there. /srv/docker-compose/nginx/nginx/Dockerfile FROM nginx:mainline COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html /srv/docker-compose/nginx/nginx/index.html <h1>Hello, World!</h1> With these two files in place you are ready to start nginx: cd /srv/docker-compose/nginx docker-compose up --detach Writing Your Own Service \u00b6 Now we'll look at a more complex example- we'll implement our own service along with the infrastructure it needs. In this example we'll stub out an application that uses a redis backend. As before, we start by creating the directories we need: mkdir -p /srv/docker-compose/my_cool_app/my_cool_app Create some files: /srv/docker-compose/my_cool_app/docker-compose.yml version: '3' services: my_cool_app: build: ./nginx ports: - \"80:80\" redis: image: redis:latest ports: - \"6379:6379\" restart: always /srv/docker-compose/my_cool_app/my_cool_app/Dockerfile FROM debian:stable COPY my_cool_app / ENTRYPOINT [\"/my_cool_app\"] /srv/docker-compose/my_cool_app/my_cool_app/my_cool_app #!/usr/bin/env python3 import time print('Hello, World!') while True: sleep(0.1) With these files in place you're ready to run your service. There are two ways you can run it: Development mode : Use this while you are actively developing the app. Logs for all services will display on STDOUT and pressing ^C will stop all the containers. cd /srv/docker-compose/my_cool_app docker-compose down # This ensures that you have a fresh start docker-compose up Production mode : Use this when you want your service to run normally, even after you logout. cd /srv/docker-compose/my_cool_app docker-compose down # This ensures that you have a fresh start docker-compose up --detach","title":"Docker Compose"},{"location":"infrastructure/docker-compose/#docker-compose","text":"Docker Compose is the standard way to manage services using Docker.

The base requirements to get started are surprisingly small. You may also choose to have multiple computers for performance or redundancy purposes. There's really a wide range of possibilities, and what you choose will depend a lot on your needs. Capacity Planning \u00b6 You'll want to do some basic capacity planning to know whether your system can handle your planned load. Here are some things to keep in mind when doing that. Mosquitto consumes around 100mb RAM. Each python service consumes at least 15mb RAM, but more likely consumes closer to 50mb of RAM. With proper log rotation my stored data is less than 1gb. Homebridge can consume a lot of RAM, depending on how many plugins you run. I regularly see 150mb+. If you add HomeAssistant, openHab, or other \"all-in-one\" systems your footprint will significantly increase. If you want to record video, especially with motion detection, your footprint will dramatically increase. In general if your system has at least 2gb of RAM and 64gb of storage you will be just fine, but list out your planned services and the expected RAM and Disk usage to sanity check this assumption. Hardware Choices \u00b6 Almost any hardware is usable for IoT-FS, from a lowly Raspberry Pi running at 1GHz all the way up to a multi-processor Xeon running at 3.5GHz. As such this is what we recommend you use, ordered from strongest to weakest suggestion.

Reliability Considerations \u00b6 The reliability of your system starts with hardware. You want a system that won't randomly lock up due to hardware faults, and you want to protect your data in the event of drive failures.

To find success you will need to do your own deep diving from time to time. Do not be afraid to seek out documentation, videos, and other support and knowledge while you work on your IoT-FS project. Target Audience \u00b6 This book assumes you already have a basic understand of developing software in at least one programming language. You should already be familiar with concepts like editing plain text files, writing structured files like JSON and YAML, and using HTTP or other network protocols. You don't need to know any language in particular, you can run someone else's code without knowing the programming language, and you can write your own services in whatever language you want. If your current or desired job title is on this list, IoT-FS is an excellent way to develop your skills and build a portfolio of personal projects to show off.

Docker Containers are the most widely used, but all container technology shares the same basic premise- the userland of the OS is the deployable unit. When you launch a container it does not run in the host OS, but in a self-contained and isolated environment. Every tool, library, and configuration file available to your service is bundled together and deployed as a single unit. This decouples your applications from one another, and from the host OS. You will be able to install applications with conflicting dependencies side by side, because each application will only its own files. You can still share files and other resources between applications if necessary, but those applications can be running on wildly different software stacks.","title":"Containers"},{"location":"overview/containers/#containers","text":"In recent years containers have become the preferred way to deploy software at scale.

It often sits at the opposite end of the spectrum from the Monolithic Architecture Pattern , where the application lives entirely in a single service. There is nothing wrong with following either pattern, but this guide focuses on microservices for two main reasons: You are able to leverage existing home automation microservices that have been released as open source. It breaks your project down into friendly weekend sized pieces. Most IoT-FS projects are neither pure microservices or pure monolithic.

It is a lightweight message transport that you will both read from and publish to. Clients connect to the MQTT server to send and/or receive messages from other clients connected to the same server. When a client sends a message to MQTT it contains two important pieces of information, the topic and the payload . In the diagram below we show a temperature sensor publishing a reading. The topic is the bedroom/sensor/bedroom_temperature part, while the payload is 22.8 . The clients on the right have subscribed to the topic for this sensor and as such will receive a copy of the message. MQTT Topics \u00b6 The topic is how the MQTT server routes messages. Clients subscribe to one or more topics and the MQTT server routes all matching messages to those clients. Topics are similar to file paths, they are slash ( / ) separated strings that indicate unique resources. Here are some examples of topics I see on my MQTT server: homeassistant/binary_sensor/Kitchen-FrontdoorDetector/contact/config weather/daily/0/temp/day_C rtl_433/7b85b6eafe6d/devices/Acurite-Tower/A/9181/temperature_C zwave/Kitchen/FrontdoorDetector/113/0/Access_Control/Door_state As you can see there is a structure to MQTT topics, but that structure is not always well defined. Wildcards \u00b6 When subscribing to MQTT topics the client can utilize wildcards. This allows the client to subscribe to multiple topics easily, or even to listen on every topic. The available wildcards are: + : Similar to the * wildcard in shell, this matches any string contained between topic parts (Denoted by the slash ( / ) character.) # : This is similar to + , but it will match against all following topic parts as well. Some examples: +/sensor/+ : Subscribe to all of the esphome sensors, which are always in the format <room>/sensor/<room>_<sensor> homeassistant/# : Subscribe to the Home Assistant MQTT Discovery topics # : Subscribe to everything MQTT Payloads \u00b6 To the MQTT server a payload is just an array of bytes. It delivers this payload exactly as it was received, it's up to the client to correctly decode the payload. In practice payloads are almost always ASCII or UTF-8 encoded text, even when dealing with numeric data. (Note: In MQTT 5 there is new metadata to indicate the payload's format and content type. We are focusing on MQTT 3 for now as it is the most widely-deployed protocol.) Some applications use single-value payloads. These payloads are typically strings or simple ints or floats encoded as strings. Some applications encode their payload using JSON to allow for more complex data to be sent. Neither pattern is right or wrong, they simply grew out of the requirements of the application. Quality Of Service \u00b6 Messages sent to MQTT are (usually) delivered to clients in the order they are received. If your connection to the server is stable they will always be in order. If your connection is not stable it will depend on the Quality Of Service (QOS) level set: QOS=0 : the message may not get delivered QOS=1 : the message may get delivered more than once QOS=2 : the message will get delivered exactly once It's not important to understand the difference between these right now, it's enough to know that you can choose the level of reliability to match your application's needs. MQTT Standards \u00b6 As you can tell MQTT allows for a broad range of usage patterns. There have been two attempts to standardize these patterns that are worth your time to read: mqtt-smarthome The Homie Convention As you read these keep in mind that neither standard has been widely adopted.","title":"MQTT"},{"location":"overview/mqtt/#mqtt","text":"MQTT is the core infrastructure you will build your IoT-FS around.
