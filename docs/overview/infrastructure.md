# Infrastructure

Infrastructure is the physical hardware and service management software you use to deploy your microservices. There are a lot of choices here, and what you pick will mostly depend on what you want to learn. There is a wide variety of hardware to pick from as well, such as compact PCs, server PCs, and Raspberry Pi.

Whatever hardware you choose you will need an operating system as well. This book assumes you will dedicate at least one computer to this project and focuses on using Linux and Docker on those computer(s). As such it doesn't matter which Linux distribution you choose, most of your work will happen on a layer above.

We chose Docker because it is well known and used in a plurality of environments. There are other container and virtualization solutions out there, and if they meet your needs better you can use them.
