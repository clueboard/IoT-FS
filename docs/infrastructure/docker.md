# Docker on a Server

While it's possible to wrangle services on a single machine, often you will run into conflict between services. Enter Docker- the easy way to keep your apps separate without the pain and overhead of traditional virtualization. This is an easy upgrade for any basic Linux server, and in fact you can start using Docker without disturbing your current services.

To get started just install docker for your platform.

## Docker on Linux

Your distribution may ship with docker already. This will work perfectly fine in most cases, but you may want to [use docker-ce instead](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to have the latest version.

## Docker on macOS

If you use homebrew you can install docker with a simple `brew install docker`.

## Docker on Windows

On Windows you will need to use [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/).
