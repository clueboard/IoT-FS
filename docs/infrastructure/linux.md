# Linux

[Linux](https://linux.org/) is the most popular server OS in the world. There are many distributions to pick from and nearly all of them can run Docker. We recommend you use Linux for your IoT-FS project because you can be guaranteed that pretty much everything you want to run will work on it.

## What Linux Distribution Should I Use?

If you're just starting out and have no idea what to use, pick the latest [Ubuntu LTS](https://ubuntu.com/blog/what-is-an-ubuntu-lts-release) release. Ubuntu is popular and well known, and you will be able to find lots of help for it.

If you have a favorite Linux distribution already use that. Likewise, if your employer has a distribution they use pick that one instead. This will help you learn the tools you use at work.
