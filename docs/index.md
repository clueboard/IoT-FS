# Internet of Things - From Scratch!

Or, how to build your own smart home based around a microservice architecture.

# What Is This?

This book is a guide for building your own IoT (or Smart Home, etc) Infrastructure using MQTT and a collection of services. Think of it as the Smart Home equivalent of [Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/).

# Why Would I want To Build My Own IoT?

There are many reasons people decide to build their own smarthome infrastructure:

* Learning- It's a great way to learn about microservice architectures and how to run them.
* Reliability- You want a system that you can make as reliable and resiliant as possible.
* Security- Because that's what the S in IoT stands for.
* Control- You want to control exactly what runs in your home, not turn it over to Big Tech.

# Why don't you use HomeAssistant/openHAB/ioBroker/etc?

Those are fine tools. In fact, they might be a part of your IoT-FS setup in some capacity! This book is not about foregoing those tools, but about building an IoT platform that is specific to you.

# How Do I Use This Book?

In the top bar of this site you'll see links directly to each chapter. On the left (or in the hamburger menu if you have a narrow browser) you will find links to each page of the current chapter. There are also links to the previous and next page at the bottom you can use to navigate.

You are encouraged to read through the entire book, or at least skim the first few paragraphs of each page, before you start building. Each chapter builds on the last and you may find yourself lost if you skip ahead. Once you have an idea of how it all fits together you'll find yourself coming back to reread specific chapters and pages.
