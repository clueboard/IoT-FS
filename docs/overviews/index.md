# Introduction

This guide will give you a broad overview of how to build your IoT-FS smart home. Our goal is to document the paths, not to recommend one over another.

## Target Audience

This guide assumes you already have a basic understand of developing software in at least one programming language. You should already be familiar with concepts like editing plain text files, writing structured files like JSON and YAML, and using HTTP or other network protocols. You don't need to know any language in particular, you can run someone else's code without knowing the programming language, and you can write your own services in whatever language you want.

If your current or desired job title is on this list, IoT-FS is an excellent way to develop your skills and build a portfolio of personal projects to show off.

* Programmer
* Software Engineer
* DevOps
* Site Reliability Engineer
* Infrastructure/Platform Engineer

## Basic Understanding

The rest of this chapter will cover some basic concepts you will need to familiarize yourself with as you begin your journey. You don't have to dive deep, for now a surface understanding of the technology is enough.
