While it is focused on defining and running multi-container applications it also works well for managing the configuration of single-container applications. See the official documentation for a more in-depth explanation. Structure For Your Docker Compose Infrastructure \u00b6 While it is possible to work with multiple docker-compose.yml files within the same directory, most people find it easier to build a directory tree to store their services and configuration. This allows for a lot of flexibility when it comes to building and managing your services. There are many ways you manage these files, but this is what we recommend for maximum flexibility and ease of use. Basic setup \u00b6 First, pick a home for your directory tree. This can be anywhere, but in most situations we recommend /srv/docker . For the rest of this guide we will assume you have placed your directory tree there. sudo mkdir -p /srv/docker-compose sudo chown ` whoami ` /srv/docker-compose Within this directory you will create directories for every service you want to run. Note The term \"service\" here is used in a slightly different way that you may be used to. In this context a service is any collection of one or more containers. Each container runs a single daemon process, which is what you may be used to thinking of as a service. Create Your First Service \u00b6 Let's start by setting up a service for the Mosquitto MQTT broker. This will demonstrate setting up a simple service which someone else has published a container for. First we'll create directories for it. Notice that we have created a directory in /srv/docker-compose and directories for volume mounts in /srv/mosquitto . If you are setting up a service that doesn't need volume mounts you can skip that. sudo mkdir -p /srv/docker-compose/mosquitto /srv/mosquitto/conf /srv/mosquitto/data /srv/mosquitto/log Create the /srv/docker-compose/mosquitto/docker-compose.yml file: /srv/docker-compose/mosquitto/docker-compose.yml version: \"3\" services: mosquitto: image: eclipse-mosquitto volumes: - ./conf:/mosquitto/conf - ./data:/mosquitto/data - ./log:/mosquitto/log ports: - 1883:1883 - 9001:9001 Create the mosquitto.conf configuration file: /srv/mosquitto/conf/mosquitto.conf persistence true persistence_location /mosquitto/data/ log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log listener 1883 Once this is in place you can use docker-compose to bring it up: cd /srv/docker-compose/mosquitto docker-compose up --detach If you want to watch the logs you can attach to them like this: cd /srv/docker-compose/mosquitto docker-compose logs To bring the service down: cd /srv/docker-compose/mosquitto docker-compose down Custom Docker Containers \u00b6 Sometimes you need to customize a container before it gets deployed. Docker provides a mechanism for doing so using Dockerfile . We'll demonstrate how to do that by creating a custom nginx service. As before we need to create the docker-compose directory: sudo mkdir -p /srv/docker-compose/nginx/nginx Notice that we did not include a data directory in /srv , and we added an extra /nginx to the end of our path? The first nginx path component refers to the service, while the second nginx path component refers to the container. Now we create the docker-compose.yml file: /srv/docker-compose/nginx/docker-compose.yml version: '3' services: nginx: build: ./nginx ports: - \"80:80\" This is where the second nginx directory comes into play- we are going to create a Dockerfile and an index.html inside of there. /srv/docker-compose/nginx/nginx/Dockerfile FROM nginx:mainline COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html /srv/docker-compose/nginx/nginx/index.html <h1>Hello, World!</h1> With these two files in place you are ready to start nginx: cd /srv/docker-compose/nginx docker-compose up --detach Writing Your Own Service \u00b6 Now we'll look at a more complex example- we'll implement our own service along with the infrastructure it needs. In this example we'll stub out an application that uses a redis backend. As before, we start by creating the directories we need: sudo mkdir -p /srv/docker-compose/my_cool_app/my_cool_app Create some files: /srv/docker-compose/my_cool_app/docker-compose.yml version: '3' services: my_cool_app: build: ./nginx ports: - \"80:80\" redis: image: redis:latest ports: - \"6379:6379\" restart: always /srv/docker-compose/my_cool_app/my_cool_app/Dockerfile FROM debian:stable COPY my_cool_app / ENTRYPOINT [\"/my_cool_app\"] /srv/docker-compose/my_cool_app/my_cool_app/my_cool_app #!/usr/bin/env python3 import time print('Hello, World!') while True: sleep(0.1) With these files in place you're ready to run your service. There are two ways you can run it: Development mode : Use this while you are actively developing the app. Logs for all services will display on STDOUT and pressing ^C will stop all the containers. cd /srv/docker-compose/my_cool_app docker-compose down # This ensures that you have a fresh start docker-compose up Production mode : Use this when you want your service to run normally, even after you logout. cd /srv/docker-compose/my_cool_app docker-compose down # This ensures that you have a fresh start docker-compose up --detach","title":"Docker Compose"},{"location":"infrastructure/docker-compose/#docker-compose","text":"Docker Compose is the standard way to manage services using Docker.

It is a lightweight message transport that you will both read from and publish to. Clients connect to the MQTT server to send and/or receive messages from other clients connected to the same server. When a client sends a message to MQTT it contains two important pieces of information, the topic and the payload . In the diagram below we show a temperature sensor publishing a reading. The topic is the bedroom/sensor/bedroom_temperature part, while the payload is 22.8 . The clients on the right have subscribed to the topic for this sensor and as such will receive a copy of the message. MQTT Topics \u00b6 The topic is how the MQTT server routes messages. Clients subscribe to one or more topics and the MQTT server routes all matching messages to those clients. Topics are similar to file paths, they are slash ( / ) separated strings that indicate unique resources. Here are some examples of topics I see on my MQTT server: homeassistant/binary_sensor/Kitchen-FrontdoorDetector/contact/config weather/daily/0/temp/day_C rtl_433/7b85b6eafe6d/devices/Acurite-Tower/A/9181/temperature_C zwave/Kitchen/FrontdoorDetector/113/0/Access_Control/Door_state As you can see there is a structure to MQTT topics, but that structure is not always well defined. Wildcards \u00b6 When subscribing to MQTT topics the client can utilize wildcards. This allows the client to subscribe to multiple topics easily, or even to listen on every topic. The available wildcards are: + : Similar to the * wildcard in shell, this matches any string contained between topic parts (Denoted by the slash ( / ) character.) # : This is similar to + , but it will match against all following topic parts as well.

It delivers this payload exactly as it was received, it's up to the client to correctly decode the payload. In practice payloads are almost always ASCII or UTF-8 encoded text, even when dealing with numeric data. (Note: In MQTT 5 there is new metadata to indicate the payload's format and content type. We are focusing on MQTT 3 for now as it is the most widely-deployed protocol.) Some applications use single-value payloads. These payloads are typically strings or simple ints or floats encoded as strings. Some applications encode their payload using JSON to allow for more complex data to be sent. Neither pattern is right or wrong, they simply grew out of the requirements of the application. Quality Of Service \u00b6 Messages sent to MQTT are (usually) delivered to clients in the order they are received. If your connection to the server is stable they will always be in order. If your connection is not stable it will depend on the Quality Of Service (QOS) level set: QOS=0 : the message may not get delivered QOS=1 : the message may get delivered more than once QOS=2 : the message will get delivered exactly once It's not important to understand the difference between these right now, it's enough to know that you can choose the level of reliability to match your application's needs. MQTT Standards \u00b6 As you can tell MQTT allows for a broad range of usage patterns. There have been two attempts to standardize these patterns that are worth your time to read: mqtt-smarthome The Homie Convention As you read these keep in mind that neither standard has been widely adopted.","title":"MQTT"},{"location":"overviews/mqtt/#mqtt","text":"MQTT is the core infrastructure you will build your IoT-FS around. It is a lightweight message transport that you will both read from and publish to. Clients connect to the MQTT server to send and/or receive messages from other clients connected to the same server. When a client sends a message to MQTT it contains two important pieces of information, the topic and the payload . In the diagram below we show a temperature sensor publishing a reading. The topic is the bedroom/sensor/bedroom_temperature part, while the payload is 22.8 . The clients on the right have subscribed to the topic for this sensor and as such will receive a copy of the message.","title":"MQTT"},{"location":"overviews/mqtt/#mqtt-topics","text":"The topic is how the MQTT server routes messages. Clients subscribe to one or more topics and the MQTT server routes all matching messages to those clients. Topics are similar to file paths, they are slash ( / ) separated strings that indicate unique resources.
